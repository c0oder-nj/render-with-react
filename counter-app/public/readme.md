1) jsx --> java script xml

2) component --> are the functions in js (functions are the block of code who performes some action) (e.g cpp class in react is component)
but nowadays class is not used now react used function based components 

component tab bolenge ham jab vo return krega html ke format me.

a function or class take input as a property and return something in the fomrat of xml is termed as component

component types: -
class component
function component


3) state --> memory (is used to store any data in react) 

4) props (property) --> state and props hamesha saath saath rehte hai ham saath saath hai :-) (-:

5) npm --> node package manager (used to manage predefined packages and libraries written in node.js)
6) npx --> npm version used for react


things related to react:-
react 16 is very stable and mostly used and have a strong community 

react packages :-
								npx create-react-app
                complete command is npx create-react-app my_app_name
                
                https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app 
                

curly bracketes are necessary when you want to use js in react

functional components are stateless components

in order to use state
